1. Did he/she hear of our shop before? any essence of this column?
2. How do we accommodate new mobile models that will be introduced and mobiles that will be outdated soon?
3. What are embedding techniques? 
4. When using frequency encoding for clustering , how to handle new mobile models?
5. Tell me more about online learning clustering algorithms
6. Tell me more about hashing encoding
7. Preprocessing steps to be done for clustering
8. Tell me more on how to perform Feature Selection


# Preprocessing Steps
1. Handle missing data
2. Standardization
3. Encode categorical variables
4. Feature Selection (Correlation analysis/backward elimination/forward selection etc)
5. Handling outliers
6. Reduce Dimensionality
7. Rescale dataset if new variables are added/transformed
8. Choose and Evaluate the Features Vs Feature Selection (Correlation analysis)
9. Prepare for dynamic data (Mobile Models)
10. Embeddings deep learning (instead of OneHotEncoder)
11. Periodic Features
